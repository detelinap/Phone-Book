Phonebook Application with Express.js, Axios, SQLite, and React.js

Welcome to the Phonebook Application repository! This project is a simple web application that allows users to manage their contacts in a phonebook. It's built using a stack of technologies that include Express.js, Axios for API calls, SQLite for database management, and React.js for the user interface.

Features:
- Add new contacts with names and phone numbers.
- View, edit, and delete existing contacts.
- Search for contacts based on name.
- RESTful API endpoints built with Express.js to handle CRUD operations.
- Client-side rendering using React.js for a smooth user experience.
- Asynchronous communication between the client and server using Axios.

Technology Stack:
- Backend: Express.js for creating the RESTful API endpoints and server.
- Frontend: React.js for building the user interface and components.
- Database: SQLite for storing and managing contact information.
- HTTP Requests: Axios for making API requests between the client and server.
